Personal Project to build a blockchain. 

I chose this project because at the beginning of my journey as a software engineer I built a project while attending Turing School of Software & Engineering that required us to create our own linked list.
After finding out that Blockchains are essentially Linked Lists, I wanted to challenge myself to build one from scratch. At the time Linked Lists were challenging to understand as I had just learned what an array, method, and classes were.
So now I want to revisit an old topic but build on to it with a more complex subject.
